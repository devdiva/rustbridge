# Intro to Rust

### Goal

_TODO add goals for the intro tutorials._

### Meta-Goal

_TODO_

### Schedule

_TODO add estimated time per lesson_

### Requirements

We are going to be working with:

* [Rust][1]
* [Cargo][2]
* Terminal
* Text Editor

Everything should be set up before during our [install-fest][3].  Please ensure you have 
everything working _before_ you show up for RustBridge.

You can verify that you have everything working by trying this out in your terminal.

Check that you have Rust.  

```bash
rustc --version
```

You should see something like `rustc 1.10.0 (cfcb716cf 2016-07-03)`

Next, check that you have Cargo.

```bash
cargo --version
```

You should see something like `cargo 0.11.0-nightly (259324c 2016-05-20)`


## Working Effectively and Efficiently

_TODO add any tips_


### Format

_TODO add formatting or how to read notes._
