### Requirements

We are going to be working with:

* Rust

Everything should be set up before during our install-fest.  Please ensure you have 
everything working _before_ you show up for RustBridge.

You can verify that you have everything working by trying this out in your terminal.

Check that you have Rust (at least version X).

```bash
rustc --version
```

Check that you have Cargo (at least version X).

```bash
cargo --version
